##  Date  
29-12-2025  

##  Topics Learned  
- What web application components are  
- Frontend and backend components  
- Role of databases in web applications  
- Why understanding components is important for security  

##  Tools / Platforms Used  
- Web development articles

##  What I Learned Today  

Today I learned about common components used in web applications.  
A web application is made up of multiple parts that work together to provide functionality.

I understood that the frontend is the part users interact with, such as forms and pages.  
The backend handles logic, authentication, and data processing.

I also learned about databases, which store user data and application information.  
If any component is poorly designed or insecure, it can affect the entire application.

Understanding these components helps in identifying where security checks should be implemented.

##  Key Takeaways  
- Web applications have multiple components  
- Frontend handles user interaction  
- Backend processes logic and security  
- Databases store important data
