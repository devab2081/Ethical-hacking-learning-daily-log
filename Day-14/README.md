##  What I Learned Today  

Today I learned about web application architecture.  
Web application architecture describes how different parts of a web application are designed and how they work together.

I understood that a typical web application has three main parts: the client, the server, and the database.  
The client sends requests, the server processes them, and the database stores data.

I also learned that understanding architecture is important for security.  
If the architecture is weak or poorly designed, it can lead to security issues.

Knowing how data flows between components helps in identifying where security checks should be applied.

##  Key Takeaways  
- Web architecture explains how applications work  
- Client, server, and database are core components  
- Data flow understanding is important for security  
- Strong architecture improves application security
